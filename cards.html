                <h1>Naruto Uzumaki</h1>
                <p>Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto) is a Ninja from Konohagakure. He became the jinchūriki of
                    the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha
                    throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's
                    acknowledgment all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage.</p>

                <p>Sasuke Uchiha (うちはサスケ, Uchiha Sasuke) is one of the last surviving members of Konohagakure's Uchiha
                    clan. After his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to
                    avenge them by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja and, through competition
                    with his rival and best friend, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke starts developing his skills.</p>

                <h1>Kakashi Hatake</h1>
                <p>Kakashi Hatake (はたけカカシ, Hatake Kakashi) is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan. Famed as Kakashi
                    of the Sharingan, he is one of Konoha's most talented ninja, regularly looked to for advice and
                    leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his
                    students on Team 7, Kakashi emphasises the importance of teamwork; he himself received this lesson,
                    along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha.</p>
